# **new-gpio**
Alternative C/C++ code to control Onion Omega GPIO pins

##This repository is no longer supported.  It has been superceded by code in the repository https://github.com/KitBishop/Omega-GPIO-I2C-Arduino 

Provides the following components:

+ **libnew-gpio** - static and dynamic link libraries provding GPIO access
+ **new-gpio** - a program that can be used to access GPIO pins similar to the Omega supplied **fast-gpio** program
+ **new-expled** - a program that uses GPIO pin access to control expansion dock led similar to the Omega supplied **expled** script

See file **`new-gpio.pdf`** for detailed documentation
